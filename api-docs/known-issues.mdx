## Current Known Issues

### Data Availability Limitations

<Warning>
**Missing Developer Information**

**Issue**: Developer/owner information is not available in the unified projects endpoint.

**Impact**: All project queries return `null` or no developer field.

**Status**: Developer infrastructure exists in the database but is not yet exposed in the API.

**Timeline**: Developer field integration planned for upcoming release.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**EIA 860M `operating_month` Field Type**

**Issue**: The `operating_month` field returns as a string instead of a number.

**Workaround**: Use the `operating_date` field for reliable date processing.

**Timeline**: Data pipeline fix planned for upcoming release.
</Warning>

### Status Mapping Improvements

<Note>
**Active Status Mapping Development**

**Issue**: Project status mappings are actively being refined to improve accuracy across all ISOs.

**Current Focus**: 
- Standardizing status categories across CAISO, ERCOT, PJM, MISO, NYISO, NE-ISO, and SPP
- Refining cancelled vs inactive project classifications
- Optimizing complex status logic for multi-field ISOs (NE-ISO, SPP)

**During Beta**: Status mapping logic may undergo updates to improve data consistency. All changes will be documented in our update log to maintain transparency.

**Timeline**: Ongoing improvements throughout beta period based on data validation results.
</Note>

### Technology Filtering Limitations

<Note>
**Hybrid Project Coverage Gaps**

**Issue**: Hybrid project filtering only works for 5 out of 8 data sources.

**✅ Available (1,343 projects)**: PJM, MISO, SPP, NE-ISO, NYISO  
**❌ Not Available**: CAISO, ERCOT, EIA 860M

</Note>

## API Behavior Notes

### Error Handling
- **Queue endpoints** require minimum 50 records per request
- **Technology filters** are case-insensitive  
- **Invalid parameters** return clear error messages with HTTP status codes

### Data Monitoring
- **Cancelled projects** from all sources are being verified post-launch
- **Multi-source integration** is under ongoing monitoring



# Future Enhancements

**Planned Improvements**:
- Unified hybrid identification across all sources

**Timeline**: Future API versions based on user feedback

## Reporting Issues

**What to Include**:
1. **Endpoint affected** and **issue description**
2. **Exact API call** that demonstrates the problem
3. **Expected vs actual response**
4. (Optional, helps with prioritization) **Your use case** and impact

### Contact
- **Documentation Feedback**: Please report any issue directly via email during beta.

<Tip>
**Issue Submission Form**: Automated issue submission system in development for streamlined reporting and tracking.
