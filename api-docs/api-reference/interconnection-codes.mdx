## Technology Classifications

Each ISO uses slightly different terminology to describe project technologies. For example, one ISO might list a project as "Photovoltaic," another as "Solar PV," and a third as simply "Solar." These inconsistencies make it difficult to compare technologies across datasets or group them for analysis without extensive cleaning.

To solve this, we normalize technology terms into a standardized set of categories. This ensures consistent labeling across projects, regardless of the original source, and makes it easier for users to filter by technology type, track deployment trends, or compare development pipelines across geographies and markets.

We also provide the original technology column to enable users to do their own standardizations or in-depth data ISO-specific analysis.

The table below outlines our core technology classifications and shows how common ISO-specific terms are mapped into each category.

### Standardized Technology Types

| Standard Technology | Description | Common ISO Variations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solar** | Solar photovoltaic projects | Photovoltaic, Solar PV, PV, Solar |
| **Wind** | Onshore and offshore wind | Wind Turbine, Wind, Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind |
| **Battery** | Battery energy storage systems | Storage, Battery Storage, BESS, Energy Storage |
| **Hybrid - Solar + Storage** | Co-located solar and battery | Solar + Storage, Hybrid Solar |
| **Hybrid - Wind + Storage** | Co-located wind and battery | Wind + Storage, Hybrid Wind |
| **Hybrid - Solar + Wind** | Co-located solar and wind | Solar + Wind |
| **Natural Gas** | Natural gas generation | Gas, Combined Cycle, Simple Cycle, Combustion Turbine |
| **Nuclear** | Nuclear power generation | Nuclear |
| **Hydroelectric** | Hydroelectric generation | Hydro, Water, Hydroelectric |
| **Geothermal** | Geothermal generation | Geothermal, Steam Turbine (Geothermal) |
| **Biomass** | Biomass and biofuel generation | Biofuel, Wood, Landfill Gas |
| **Coal** | Coal generation | Coal, Steam Turbine (Coal) |
| **Other** | Other technologies | Fuel Cell, Hydrogen, Transmission |

### ISO-Specific Technology Field Differences

<Warning>
**CAISO Special Case**: CAISO structures technology data differently from other ISOs. While most ISOs use a single field for technology classification, CAISO uses separate `technology` and `fuel` fields:

- **`technology`**: Contains CAISO's original technical terms (e.g., "Photovoltaic", "Storage")
- **`fuel`**: Contains standardized fuel types (e.g., "Solar", "Battery")

**Impact on Filtering**: When using `technology=Solar` filter on CAISO data, the API automatically searches both fields to ensure consistent results. This means you'll get projects where either:
- `technology` field contains "Solar" OR
- `fuel` field contains "Solar"

**Example CAISO Response**:
```json
{
  "technology": "Photovoltaic",
  "fuel": "Solar",
  "technology_normalized": "Solar"
}
```

This approach ensures cross-ISO compatibility while preserving CAISO's original data structure.
</Warning>

### How We Handle Hybrid Projects

Hybrid projects present unique data challenges because each ISO handles them differently in their source data. Our API provides standardized hybrid technology classifications while preserving these original data structures:

- **CAISO**: Represents hybrid projects as single rows in their Excel files with multiple technology columns (Type-1, Type-2, Type-3). Our API splits these into separate records for each technology component, allowing you to query individual components while maintaining relationships through the site_id field.

- **ERCOT**: Unlike CAISO, ERCOT's Excel files already contain separate rows for each technology component, each with its own INR number. Co-located hybrid projects appear as multiple records with similar naming patterns (e.g., "Lupinus Solar 1-3" and "Lupinus Storage 1-3").

- **PJM**: Uses single rows with semicolon-separated technology combinations in the fuel column (e.g., "Solar; Storage", "Wind; Storage").

- **SPP**: Single rows with slash-separated combinations in the fuel_type field and a generation_type value of "Hybrid" (e.g., fuel_type="Solar/Storage").

- **MISO**: Single rows where fuel_type="Hybrid" and the facility_type field specifies the combination (e.g., "Solar/Battery", "Wind/Battery").

- **NYISO**: Uses single-letter hybrid codes like "CR" (Combined Renewable = Solar + Storage) and "CW" (Combined Wind = Wind + Storage).

- **ISO-NE**: Represents hybrids with space-separated fuel codes in single rows (e.g., "SUN BAT" for Solar + Battery).

<Note>
**Key Insight**: The fundamental difference is that CAISO uses multiple columns within one row for hybrid projects, while ERCOT uses multiple rows. All other ISOs use single rows with various encoding schemes to represent the hybrid nature.
</Note>

#### Detailed Raw Data Formats by ISO

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CAISO">
    **Raw Excel Structure**: Single row per project with multiple technology columns
    - Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 columns for different technologies
    - MW-1, MW-2, MW-3 columns for corresponding capacities
    - Fuel-1, Fuel-2, Fuel-3 columns for fuel types
    
    **API Response**: Each technology component appears as a separate record in our API response. This allows you to:
    - Query individual technology components
    - Track capacity by technology type
    - Group related components using the `site_id` field
    
    **Example**: A 100 MW solar + 50 MW battery project in CAISO's Excel (Type-1="Photovoltaic", MW-1=100, Type-2="Storage", MW-2=50) becomes two API records with the same `site_id`.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ERCOT">
    **Raw Excel Structure**: Separate rows for each technology component
    - Each component has its own INR (Interconnection Request) number
    - Single "Fuel" and "Technology" column per row
    - Related projects often share similar naming patterns
    
    **API Response**: Each technology component appears as a separate record, matching ERCOT's structure. To identify related hybrid components, look for:
    - Similar project naming patterns (e.g., "Lupinus Solar 1" and "Lupinus Storage 1")
    - Same POI location
    - References in the comments field
    
    **Example**: A solar + storage project appears as two separate rows in ERCOT's Excel:
    - Row 1: INR=23INR0035, Project Name="Starling Solar", Fuel="SOL", Capacity=123 MW
    - Row 2: INR=23INR0181, Project Name="Starling Storage", Fuel="OTH", Capacity=63.6 MW
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="PJM">
    **Raw Excel Structure**: Single row with combined technology field
    - Fuel column contains semicolon-separated values (e.g., "Solar; Storage")
    - Single capacity value represents total project capacity
    
    **API Response**: Single record per hybrid project with:
    - Original combined technology string preserved in the `fuel` field
    - `technology_normalized` field set to appropriate hybrid category (e.g., "Hybrid - Solar + Storage")
    - Total project capacity (individual component capacities not available)
    
    **Example**: A hybrid project appears as one API record with fuel="Solar; Storage", technology_normalized="Hybrid - Solar + Storage", capacity_mw=150
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="MISO">
    **Raw CSV Structure**: Single row with dual classification
    - "Fuel" column indicates hybrid status (value: "Hybrid")
    - "Generating Facility" column specifies the combination (e.g., "Solar/Battery")
    - Separate "Summer MW" and "Winter MW" columns
    
    **API Response**: Single record per hybrid project with:
    - `fuel` field showing "Hybrid"
    - `technology` field showing the facility type (e.g., "Solar/Battery")
    - `technology_normalized` mapped to standard hybrid categories
    - Both `summer_capacity_mw` and `winter_capacity_mw` values
    
    **Example**: API record shows fuel="Hybrid", technology="Solar/Battery", technology_normalized="Hybrid - Solar + Storage", summer_capacity_mw=100, winter_capacity_mw=100
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="SPP">
    **Raw CSV Structure**: Single row with dual fields
    - "Generation Type" column (e.g., "Hybrid")
    - "Fuel Type" column with slash notation (e.g., "Solar/Storage")
    
    **API Response**: Single record showing both `generation_type` and `fuel_type` fields, with `technology_normalized` based on the combination.
    
    **Example**: generation_type="Hybrid", fuel_type="Solar/Storage", technology_normalized="Hybrid - Solar + Storage"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="NYISO">
    **Raw Excel Structure**: Single row with coded values
    - "Type/Fuel" column uses single-letter codes
    - CR = Combined Renewable (Solar + Storage)
    - CW = Combined Wind (Wind + Storage)
    
    **API Response**: Single record with the code translated to readable technology types in the `technology_normalized` field while preserving the original code in the `type_fuel` field.
    
    **Example**: type_fuel="CR", technology_normalized="Hybrid - Solar + Storage"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ISO-NE">
    **Raw Excel Structure**: Single row with space-separated codes
    - Fuel Type column contains codes like "SUN BAT" (Solar + Battery)
    - "WND BAT" for Wind + Battery combinations
    
    **API Response**: Single record with compound codes parsed into appropriate hybrid technology classifications.
    
    **Example**: fuel_type="SUN BAT", technology_normalized="Hybrid - Solar + Storage"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Key Insight**: The fundamental difference is that CAISO's raw Excel uses multiple columns within one row, while ERCOT uses multiple rows. All other ISOs use single rows with various encoding schemes to represent the hybrid nature.
</Note>

#### Important Implications for Data Analysis

<Warning>
When analyzing hybrid projects across ISOs, be aware that:

1. **Capacity Attribution**: 
   - CAISO & ERCOT: Individual component capacities are available
   - PJM, MISO, SPP: Only total project capacity is provided
   - This affects capacity summation and technology-specific analysis

2. **Project Counting**:
   - CAISO: One Excel row can become multiple API records
   - ERCOT: Already multiple rows in source data
   - Others: One-to-one mapping maintained

3. **Relationship Tracking**:
   - CAISO: Use `site_id` to group related components
   - ERCOT: No formal linking - use project name patterns
   - Others: Single record represents the entire hybrid project
</Warning>

## Status Classifications

Each ISO uses different terminology for project status, creating complexity when comparing across markets. We standardize these into five consistent categories—*Planned, Operating, Cancelled, Retired,* and *Inactive*—while preserving original status fields for detailed ISO-specific analysis.

This standardization allows you to filter, analyze, and benchmark projects reliably across regions while maintaining access to ISO-specific terminology when needed.

Below, you'll find how we map common status terms from each ISO into our standardized framework. This mapping is designed to preserve as much fidelity as possible while reducing ambiguity for downstream analysis.

### Standardized Status Types

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planned** | Active projects in interconnection process | Active, In Progress, Under Study |
| **Operating** | Projects that have achieved commercial operation | Completed, Commercial, In Service |
| **Cancelled** | Projects withdrawn or terminated | Withdrawn, Terminated, Cancelled |
| **Retired** | Operating projects that have been retired | Retired, Decommissioned |
