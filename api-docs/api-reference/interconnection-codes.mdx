# Interconnection Queues Data Guide

## Overview

This API provides standardized access to interconnection queue data from all 7 major ISOs/RTOs in the United States. Each ISO has unique field structures and naming conventions, which our API standardizes into consistent field names and technology classifications.

## Technology Classifications

Each ISO uses slightly different terminology to describe project technologies. For example, one ISO might list a project as "Photovoltaic," another as "Solar PV," and a third as simply "Solar." These inconsistencies make it difficult to compare technologies across datasets or group them for analysis without extensive cleaning.

To solve this, we normalize technology terms into a standardized set of categories. This ensures consistent labeling across projects, regardless of the original source, and makes it easier for users to filter by technology type, track deployment trends, or compare development pipelines across geographies and markets.

We also provide the original technology column to enable users to do their own standardizations or in-depth data ISO-specific analysis.

The table below outlines our core technology classifications and shows how common ISO-specific terms are mapped into each category.

### Standardized Technology Types

| Standard Technology | Description | Common ISO Variations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solar** | Solar photovoltaic projects | Photovoltaic, Solar PV, PV, Solar |
| **Wind** | Onshore and offshore wind | Wind Turbine, Wind, Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind |
| **Battery** | Battery energy storage systems | Storage, Battery Storage, BESS, Energy Storage |
| **Hybrid - Solar + Storage** | Co-located solar and battery | Solar + Storage, Hybrid Solar |
| **Hybrid - Wind + Storage** | Co-located wind and battery | Wind + Storage, Hybrid Wind |
| **Hybrid - Solar + Wind** | Co-located solar and wind | Solar + Wind |
| **Natural Gas** | Natural gas generation | Gas, Combined Cycle, Simple Cycle, Combustion Turbine |
| **Nuclear** | Nuclear power generation | Nuclear |
| **Hydroelectric** | Hydroelectric generation | Hydro, Water, Hydroelectric |
| **Geothermal** | Geothermal generation | Geothermal, Steam Turbine (Geothermal) |
| **Biomass** | Biomass and biofuel generation | Biofuel, Wood, Landfill Gas |
| **Coal** | Coal generation | Coal, Steam Turbine (Coal) |
| **Other** | Other technologies | Fuel Cell, Hydrogen, Transmission |

### How We Handle Hybrid Projects

Hybrid projects present unique data challenges because each ISO handles them differently:

- **CAISO**: Breaks hybrid projects into separate rows for each technology component, but retains some ability to map them together through project identifiers
- **ERCOT**: Lists hybrid projects in their own rows, but doesn't provide the ability to map individual technology components together
- **SPP and MISO**: Show hybrid projects in their own rows, but we can't disaggregate the capacity of each individual technology component
- **PJM, NYISO, and ISO-NE**: Use semicolon-separated or coded combinations to represent multiple technologies within a single project

This variation reflects the different approaches ISOs take to managing complex project configurations. Our API preserves these distinctions while providing standardized hybrid categories where possible.

## Status Classifications

Interconnection queue data comes from a range of sources—like CAISO, ERCOT, and PJM—each with its own terminology and classification system for tracking project status. While these terms may serve the needs of each individual ISO or RTO, they introduce complexity when aggregating or comparing projects across markets.

To provide a more unified and useful experience for users, we standardize status fields across all data sources. Our standardized status types—*Planned, Operating, Cancelled, Retired,* and *Inactive*—capture the most important lifecycle phases of a clean energy project in a way that is consistent and comparable. This allows you to filter, analyze, and benchmark projects reliably, whether you're looking at a single ISO or comparing across regions.

For each ISO we also provide the original status column to enable users to do their own standardizations or in-depth data ISO-specific analysis.

Below, you'll find how we map common status terms from each ISO into our standardized framework. This mapping is designed to preserve as much fidelity as possible while reducing ambiguity for downstream analysis.

### Standardized Status Types

| Standard Status | Description | Common ISO Variations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planned** | Active projects in interconnection process | Active, In Progress, Under Study |
| **Operating** | Projects that have achieved commercial operation | Completed, Commercial, In Service |
| **Cancelled** | Projects withdrawn or terminated | Withdrawn, Terminated, Cancelled |
| **Retired** | Operating projects that have been retired | Retired, Decommissioned |
| **Inactive** | Projects with suspended or unclear status | Suspended, On Hold, Inactive |

### Status Mapping by ISO

**CAISO Status Mapping**
- "Active" → **Planned**
- "Completed" → **Operating**
- "Withdrawn" → **Cancelled**

**ERCOT Status Mapping**
- "Active" → **Planned**
- "COM" → **Operating** 
- "WITHD" → **Cancelled**

**PJM Status Mapping**
- "Active" → **Planned**
- "In Service" → **Operating**
- "Withdrawn" → **Cancelled**

## Field Definitions

### Core Standardized Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `iso` | string | ISO/RTO identifier | All ISOs |
| `queue_id` | string | Unique queue identifier | All ISOs |
| `project_name` | string | Project name | Most ISOs |
| `capacity_mw` | number | Project capacity in MW | All ISOs |
| `technology` | string | Standardized technology type | All ISOs |

### Additional Fields by ISO

In addition to the core standardized fields listed above, each ISO has its own ISO-specific fields that provide additional details relevant to that region's interconnection process. These fields preserve the original data structure and terminology from each ISO's queue, allowing for detailed ISO-specific analysis.

<Tip>
For optimal performance, use specific filters to narrow your results. The API works best with targeted queries rather than broad data exports.
