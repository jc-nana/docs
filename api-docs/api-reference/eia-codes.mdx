## EIA 860M Reference Codes

This API uses standardized codes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to represent balancing authorities, energy sources, and prime movers. These codes are derived from official EIA forms and documentation.

Use these codes to filter or interpret results in API responses.

<Note>
**Official EIA Documentation:**
- [EIA Form 860 Data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/) (Annual Electric Power Industry Report)

## Balancing Authority Codes

<Note>
Balancing authority codes in EIA Form 860M data are standardized by NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation). These codes may not match current corporate names due to mergers, acquisitions, or other business changes. The codes used in our API data come from the EIA Form 860M monthly generator inventory reporting.
</Note>

## Energy Source Codes

<Note>
Energy source codes are defined by the EIA for Form 860M monthly generator inventory reporting. The EIA Form 860M includes a codes spreadsheet that defines energy sources and prime movers for generators with 1 MW or greater combined nameplate capacity. These are the codes used in our API data.
</Note>

These codes represent the primary fuel or energy type used at a generating facility. The most commonly used codes are:

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SUN | Solar |
| WND | Wind |
| MWH | Electricity used for energy storage (megawatt hour) |
| NUC | Nuclear |
| WAT | Water (Hydro) |

## Prime Mover Codes

<Note>
Prime mover codes identify the equipment that converts energy into electricity at power plants. These codes are standardized by the EIA for Form 860M monthly generator inventory reporting. Prime movers represent the mechanical equipment that drives the electrical generator (e.g., steam turbine, wind turbine, photovoltaic cells).
</Note>

Here is the full list of EIA prime mover codes:

| Prime mover codes | Description |
| --- | --- |
| BA | Energy Storage, Battery |

## Status Detailed Codes

<Note>
Status codes track the operational and development status of generators throughout their lifecycle. These codes are defined in EIA Form 860M monthly generator inventory reporting. The status field helps distinguish between operating, planned, under construction, and retired generators.
</Note>

The `status_detailed` field provides granular information about a generator's lifecycle stage and operational status. These codes help distinguish between various states of development, operation, and retirement.

### Lifecycle Stages and Status Details

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Operating / Active** | OP | Operating | Currently in commercial operation. |
| | SB | Standby/Backup: available for service but not normally used | Generator is available but not normally used. |
| | OA | Out of service but expected to return to service in next calendar year | Temporarily offline but expected to return soon. |
| | OS | Out of service and NOT expected to return to service in next calendar year | Offline with no expected return. |
| | OT | Other | Does not fit standard categories. |
| **Construction / Development** | U | Under construction, less than or equal to 50 percent complete | Construction started, ≤ 50% complete. |
| | V | Under construction, more than 50 percent complete | Construction underway, > 50% complete. |
| | TS | Construction complete, but not yet in commercial operation | Construction done, not yet operating. |
| **Planned / Proposed** | P | Planned for installation, but regulatory approvals not initiated | Early planning stage, no approvals yet. |
